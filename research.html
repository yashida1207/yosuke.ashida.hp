  <h1>Research History</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Beam intensity scan with ATLAS pixel detectors [2015]</b>:
    As a research project in the CERN summer student program, I was working on the beam intensity measurement in the LHC-ATLAS experiment. 
    The beam intensity is measured by the van der Meer (vdM) scan in the collider experiment, where the Gaussian shape is assumed for the beam profile. 
    I studied the potential systematic uncertainty coming from this assumption by changing the beam shape in a toy MC simulation. 
    I also analysed the vdM scan data observed by the IBL detector and measured the beam intensity roughly.

    <b>Cosmological parameter impacts on CMB B-Modes [2014]</b>:
    As a research topic for the undergraduate thesis, I was studying the impact of cosmological parameters on the CMB B-mode using the CAMB simulator.

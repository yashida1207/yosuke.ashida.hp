    <b>Data-based evaluation of cascade angular reconstruction in IceCube [2020 - 2023]</b>:
    I invented a novel data-based evaluation method for IceCube cascade angular reconstructoon by utilizing a starting track sample. 
    The strategy is to reconstruct directions of the hadronic cascade part in muon neutrino charged-current events and compare them to track directions on a per-event basis. 
    I found a significant bias in zenith angle reconstruction of cascades. 
    From the detailed study of systematic uncertainty effects, I found such bias is most likely to stem from mis-modeling of the refrozen ice in drill holes. 
    The study result is presented in a conference proceedings (<a href="https://pos.sissa.it/444/980/pdf">link</a>).

    <b>Flux of diffuse supernova neutrino background based on a new galaxy chemical evolution model [2022 - 2023]</b>:
    We calculated the diffuse supernova neutrino background flux based on a novel model on galactic chemical evolution. 
    Here, we used a variable initial mass function depending on the galaxy type and assumed failed supernovae forming a black hole for progenitors heavier than 18 solar-mass. 
    The resulting electron antineutrino flux shows characteristic enhancements at high and low energies. 
    We also investigated detectability of our new model at future water Cherenkov detectors, SK-Gd and Hyper-Kamiokande. 
    The result is shown in a paper (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace3ba">link</a>).

    <b>Trigger and bandwidth studies with simulations for IceCube-Gen2 [2021 - 2022]</b>:
    It is essential to study conditions of triggering in the data acquisition system at IceCube-Gen2, for giving feedback to hardware development. 
    I was studying this by using the Corsika simulation sets. 
    I introduced some variables that can be collected in the data acquisition flow and found benchmark conditions to achieve requirement on bandwidth for the data transfer. 
    I also investigated the impact of these benchmark conditions on the physics analysis by using the neutrino events simulated with NuGen. 
    From this study, a trigger efficiency of >90% is ensured for good neutrino events. 
    I performed multiple case studies about bandwidth and neutrino event efficiency for different benchmark conditions in order for hardware people to refer to numbers easily. 
    These results are shown in the technical design report of IceCube-Gen2 (<a href="https://icecube-gen2.wisc.edu/science/publications/tdr/">link</a>).

    <b>Diffuse supernova neutrino background as a probe to investigate stellar core collapse fate [2021 - 2022]</b>:
    We focused on the fact that the emitted neutrino spectrum from core-collapse supernovae changes depending on the fate of stellar core-collapse and therefore the diffuse supernova neutrino background measurement can potentially provide constraints on this part. 
    We investigated their flux shape for different cases of the core-collapse remnant being a typical mass neutron star, a higher mass neutron star, or a black hole from the failed supernova. 
    We also performed the sensitivity study to make constraints on the composition of these three, based on assumptions for the future water-based Cherenkov detectors, SK-Gd and Hyper-Kamiokande. 
    The result is summarized in a paper (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8a46">link</a>). 
    This work is introduced in <a href="https://astrobites.org/2022/04/22/interpreting-relics-of-stellar-burials/">astrobites</a>.

    <b>Extraterrestrial electron antineutrino search at Super-Kamiokande [2019 - 2021]</b>:
    I was analysing the Super-Kamiokande data to perform a diffuse supernova neutrino background search. 
    Here I was especially working on improving spallation background reduction, systematic uncertainty estimation of background predictions, and the final statistical analysis. 
    These efforts lead, in the end, to the world’s most sensitive search for electron antineutrinos from outside the Earth. 
    The results are presented in a paper (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.122002">link</a>). 
    Related to this work, I was contributing to a similar analysis but motivated by another physics, Lorentz violation, as searching for electron antineutrinos from the Sun. 
    The results are shown in a paper (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927650522000159">link</a>).

    <b>Neutrino neutral-current quasielastic scattering measurement in T2K [2018 - 2019]</b>:
    Neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasielastic interactions are among the major backgrounds in diffuse supernova neutrino background searches at water Cherenkov detectors. 
    I was analysing Super-Kamipkande data from T2K beams to measure this channel precisely, utilizing nuclear &gamma;-rays as a signal mode. 
    The results serve the world’s most precise measurement for both neutrino and antineutrino cross sections of this channel. 
    Especially the result for antineutrinos is the first experimental measurement ever. 
    The analysis results are published in a paper (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.112009">link</a>).

    <b>Super-Kamiokande refurbishment work [2018]</b>:
    I was joining the Super-Kamokande detector refurbishment work, which was for the later Gd loading. 
    I was dedicated to especially the outer detector work, including replacement of old PMTs and shading sheets, rust removal, etc. 
    The photos can be found in the Super-Kamiokande official website (<a href="https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/tankopen2018/photo-e.html">link</a>; a smiling guy in No.27 is me!).

    <b>T2K muon beam monitor studies [2016 - 2019]</b>:
    I was working as an expert of the muon monitor for T2K. 
    Here I managed the calibration and trouble shootings in the experimental operation and performed various studies for the current and future beam monitors. 
    We investigated the issues with the current detectors, silicon sensors and ion chambers, and confirmed their responses to the beam power. 
    As a new candidate for the future detector, replacing with the current ones, we proposed electron-multiplier tubes (EMTs) and tested with the prototype sensors. 
    The results are published in a paper (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/10/103H01/5145636?login=false">link</a>).

    <b>Measurement of &gamma;-rays from neutron-oxygen reactions [2015 - present]</b>:
    We conducted beam tests at Osaka University’s Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) to measure production cross sections of &gamma;-rays arising from the neutron-oxygen reaction. 
    This is motivated by the large systematic uncertainty regarding the relevant cross sections in the neutrino neutral-current measurement in T2K. 
    The measurement results are summarized in a paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08964">link</a>). 
    As a necessary technique to estimate the neutron background in the &gamma;-ray spectroscopy we investigated a CsI(Tl) scintillator capability of the pulse shape discrimination (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/4/043H01/4980960?login=false">link</a>).

    <b>Beam intensity scan with ATLAS pixel detectors [2015]</b>:
    As a research project in the CERN summer student program, I was working on the beam intensity measurement in the LHC-ATLAS experiment. 
    The beam intensity is measured by the van der Meer (vdM) scan in the collider experiment, where the Gaussian shape is assumed for the beam profile. 
    I studied the potential systematic uncertainty coming from this assumption by changing the beam shape in a toy MC simulation. 
    I also analysed the vdM scan data observed by the IBL detector and measured the beam intensity roughly.
